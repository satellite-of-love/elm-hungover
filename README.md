## how to run this yourself

## how we make a release
   - check out the gh-pages branch (probably in a separate repo)
   - get the commit on master that you want to release (be sure to push
     it)
   - in the gh-pages branch, `./release.sh <commit from master>`
   - `open index.html` in the gh-pages branch to make sure it worked
   - `git push` on the gh-pages branch
